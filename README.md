The objective of this project is to demonstrate the establishment and arrangement of a Kerberos authentication system that links a client, a Postgres server, and a Key Distribution Center (KDC). Through this system, the client is able to authenticate securely to the Postgres server by obtaining Kerberos tickets from the KDC.
